# POS Tagging using HMM

## Getting Started

This project implements parts of speech tagging using HMMs. Parts of Speech tagging is a linguistic activity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
wherein each word in a document is given a particular part of speech (adverb, adjective, verb, etc.) or grammatical category.


## Overview

Some keypoints of this project:

* POS tagging provides information for various NLP applications, including text analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.
* It calculates the probability of a (pos | word) by using transition and emission matrices.
* POS Tagging can also be calculated using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which includes the dependency every word can have related to its entire context.
